This fork of Tor implements QUIC support through Quiche.
Quiche is forked and included as a git submodule, clone with --recursive.

To install quiche as a shared library:
    cd src/lib/quiche
    cargo build --release
    sudo cp target/release/libquiche.so /usr/local/lib/
    sudo ldconfig

To enable QUIC, add the following line to torrc:
    QUIC 1

Tor protects your privacy on the internet by hiding the connection
between your Internet address and the services you use. We believe Tor
is reasonably secure, but please ensure you read the instructions and
configure it properly.

To build Tor from source:
        ./configure && make && make install

To build Tor from a just-cloned git repository:
        sh autogen.sh && ./configure && make && make install
